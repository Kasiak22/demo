Sometimes I wonder if I should be medicated
If I would feel better just slightly sedated
A feeling comes so fast and I cannot control it
I'm on fire, but I'm trying not to show it
As it picks me up, puts me down
It picks me up, puts me down
Picks me up, puts me down
A hundred times a day
It picks me up, puts me down
It chews me up, spits me out
Picks me up, puts me down
I'm always running from something
I push it back, but it keeps on coming
And being clever never got me very far
Because it's all in my head
And "You're too sensitive", they said
I said, "Okay, but let's discuss this at the hospital"
As it picks me up, puts me down
It picks me up, puts me down
Picks me up, puts me down
A hundred times a day
It picks me up, puts me down
It chews me up, spits me out
Picks me up, puts me down
